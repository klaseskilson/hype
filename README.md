# Hype!

Simple tool for creating a hype around an event or similar.

It basically follows the [Route separation example](https://github.com/strongloop/express/tree/dee9fbbbda2f2483c657cf912f68db1a5ba1fcac/examples/route-separation), but more messy.

## Setup

### Environment variables

Copy [`example.env`](example.env) into `.env` and provide the needed environment variables there.
